<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it –
 for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document
  in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little
   bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one,
    and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but
    will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this
    space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community,
 and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community
 and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy
 helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich
 ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy
 is to print."

You could make this document the easy way by posting on Google Site, an Adobe Spark, a Weebly, or a Wix--or
you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know
how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual
spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative,
then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use.
Through this process you will alos learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow
you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange,
tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document
that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers
how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<title>Tyler Glass CS Genius</title>

    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

     <!--this code tells the browser to link to the style.css file that controls the appearance of much of your content.-->

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->

<body style = "background:rgba(0, 150, 150, 0.75)">


<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file.
Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."
Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers
to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly
repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name).
 You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background
 image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not
 John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

<div class="hero-image">

      <h1>I am Tyler Glass</h1>
      <h2>And I Study Computer Science</h2>

</div>

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career.
      In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of
       operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future
       career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those
       same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career
        path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

     <div class="textblock">
  <h1 style = "color:white">Computer Science is Pretty Neat I Think</h1>

  <h2 style = "color:white">I generally think of Computer Science as the practice and study of problem solving, specifically in a manner that utilizes computers. In the big picture, I'd like to use my degree to solve what I see as some of the world's greatest problems,
  -- or at least some smaller problems that would make life just a little bit better. Computer Science is everywhere, and has already vastly improved our existence, whether it be through great improvements in things like medical technology and diagnosis, or
  some of the small things, like a fun co-op game to play with friends and family. Any contribution I make that can make life easier or more enjoyable would be an accomplishment to be proud of.</h2>
</div>


<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that
influenced you on this path along which you now stand).-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h1 style = "color:white">Family and Home</h1>
    </div>

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family)
 to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add
 more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the
 size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

<style>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img src="mnd.jpg" alt="mom and dad">

  <div class="column">

</div>

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going.
What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h2 style = "color:white">This is my family - my parents and my younger brother, and of course my sweet greyhound Desi. Family to me is the people who have always been there, and who are truly irreplacable. I also really value my close friends who I know I can always trust, but they don't quite fit the same definition of "family". My parents have had
  a crucial role in pushing me forward and helping to drive me to where I am today, and I know my life would be uninmaginable without them. They've always pushed me to do well in school without expecting too much out of me,
  and were always clear that I was the one who would decide where I want to be in my future. Although I am on my own path with minimal input from my parents, they've provided me the resources and support to get to where I am so far, which I will always be grateful for.</h2>
</div>

     <!--Replace the image here. You can also control image width and height %. This is the second way we can control the size of images on our website.-->

<div>
 <img src="dadndes.jpg" alt="dad and desi asleep" class="center-image"  style="max-width:25%; max-height:25%;">
    </div>

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment. You can't break this thing, right? Control Z. Control Z. Control Z... -->

<div class="textblock">
  <h1 style = "color:white">Entertainment</h1>

    <!--find a YouTube video that has some significance in your life. Click "share," and copy and paste the embed link and paste it below-->

       <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xZCiyw1ZfB0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<!--Time to process. How do you use media? What role do certain kinds of media play in your life? How does media serve a social function? In what way might you be "recreating" or "remaking" media in your everyday life?

FUN FACT: "Lorem ipsum", "Lorem ipsum" was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum," developers made it non-sensical. So while you will probably never write as well as Cicero, you can always improve upon "Lorem ipsum." -->

  <h2 style = "color:white">I do use media to inform myself - I especially like learning about politics, and really anything I can find that I'm interested in, ie. computer science, movies, TV, music, games, etc.. But media is above all for entertainment, and I would not be consuming informative media if it was not also entertaining, and most of the time, humorous. Not to mention much of what I find entertaining is not informative whatsover.
    I think that media such as movies, TV, and music have had a significant impact on my life, such as some of my moral values, interests, and what kind of people I gravitate towards. If I share similar media interests with someone, a lot of the time that means that person is someone who I can get along well with.
  In this way media can play a crucial social role, by creating a sort of common interest that can be talked and laughed about. On a daily basis I'm sure that I regurgitate some variation of things that I absorbed from whatever media outlet, whether it be the news or some random YouTube video, and even to some extent the way in which I conduct myself is likely impacted greatly by the media that I consume.</h2>
</div>

    <!--Between these divisions, you may want to add a new div element like an image (see the bottom of this html page for instructions) -->

<!--We will use this next section to process your community(-ies)-->

<div class="textblock">
  <h1 style = "color:white">Community</h1>

    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->

  <h2 style = "color:white">I would consider myself to be involved in a wide variety of communities, especially when you consider online communities. In my immediate area, I live in a community made up of mostly Pitt students on a street off campus, although this community is still quite new and unfamiliar. I am certainly part of the Pitt community, and my local community back home. I'm also involved in some larger online virtual communites that are more closely related to the kind of media I consume, and other interactions that I have with the internet. Although these communities are not so concrete and largely anonymous, they still can have a significant impact on my life (although I try not to be so terminally online).</h2>

<!-- In our final discourse section, we will process the role schooling has played in our lives. -->

<div class="textblock">
    <h1 style = "color:white">School</h1>
</div>

<!--To change the image for this wide screen paralax scroll, you will need change the file name in your style.css to match an image in your project folder. Look for ".paralax1" on your style.css sheet-->

    <div class="parallax-1"></div>

<!--Like it or not, your schooling, formal and informal, for better or for worse, has been another factor that has brought you here and prepared you for this moment. Let's think through these systems, expectations, and outcomes. And let's also think a little about futurity... where is this learning, formal and informal – this unconcealing – taking you? -->

    <div class="textblock">
  <h2 style = "color:white">My relationship with schooling has largely been a matter of fact - at the age I am, I go to school, I learn (and unlearn) some things, and I keep moving forward to the next stage of education. I'm sure that the formal education I've recieved has had significant impact on my life in some way or another. Interestingly enough however, my relationship with computer science was mostly out of my own volition, as I was largely introduced through it through informal things like YouTube rather than my high school's limited curriculum (not to mention the complete lack of any suggestion towards CS in elementary and middle school, which would have been great). Otherwise I've really enjoyed my time at Pitt so far and I am very happy with my choice to go here, and I'm looking forward to the rest of my time here.</h2>
  </div>

<!--The final step in our process will be to ensure that a smaller version of our "hero image," what Ulmer would refer to as our "wide image," repeats at the bottom of our document to better reinforce this motif.  -->
